# InfoSystemTestBoard
### Board and communication with other Information System Test students
> This is a web page for students who need information and communication about Information System Test(정보처리기사). 
>>In this page, it is divided into two sections, 1st test(필기) and 2nd test(실기). Both should work in the same way, only divided for convenience. (For now, only 2nd test is fully developed, 1st test doesn't work.)
>>>For each test section, there are 3 different boards, Q&A, Review(후기) and Information(정보). 
Each boards works and saved seperately, using their own database table in MySQL. 
>>>>Writing a new content on the board needs sign-in and log-in. The user information will be saved in a seperate talbe in MySQL. 

The project web page is done on local host, using Apache(xampp) and mysql. Not deployed, no Domain name, not be seen on www.
